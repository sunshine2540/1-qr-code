### What I learned

As this was the first time I actually developed a website from scratch, this was a great opportunity to learn about helpful tools and resources for web development and playing around with everything I learned so far. Actually making the website was completely different from just learning html and css in theory.
### Continued development

In future projects I want to delve deeper in the possibilities of css, trying out things like CSS grid or flexbox for layout design. I tried to use them in this project, but couldn't make it work, so decided later on the simpler solution. It probably wasn't the right use case for them as it was only a single card instead of several.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Card Guide](https://codefronts.com/css-card-guide/) - This guide about designing css cards from codefronts.com helped me when I got stuck with the card design using flex box and CSS grid as it provided a much simpler solution to my problem.

The Youtube tutorials from [CodeSTACKr](https://www.youtube.com/codeSTACKr) and [freecodecamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) have been mainly responsible for me daring to take on this challenge as they provided the neccessary information (and much more!) for setting up a proper development environment and many helpful tips.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox layout
- SASS/SCSS files
- Live Sass Compiler/Live Server extensions (VSCode)


### What I learned

As this was the first time I actually developed a website from scratch, this was a great opportunity to learn about helpful tools and resources for web development and playing around with everything I learned so far. Actually making the website was completely different from just learning html and css in theory.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Card Guide](https://codefronts.com/css-card-guide/) - This guide about designing css cards from codefronts.com helped me when I got stuck with the card design using flex box and CSS grid as it provided a much simpler solution to my problem.

## Acknowledgments

The Youtube tutorials from [CodeSTACKr](https://www.youtube.com/codeSTACKr) and [freecodecamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) have been mainly responsible for me daring to take on this challenge as they provided the neccessary information (and much more!) for setting up a proper development environment and many helpful tips.
